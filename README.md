# Standard Notes Markdown Editor

This flavor incorporates [hightlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/download/), and the [xcatliu theme](http://simplemde-theme-base.mazimd.com/) for better looks. It renders HTML on the initial view which I find more convenient for perusing my notes, and I changed the following shortcuts because I like them better:

* __Ctrl-Alt-P__(review) HTML
* __Ctrl-Alt-S__(plit|creen)
* __Ctrl-Alt-H__(eaders)
* __Ctrl-Alt-B__(old)
* __Ctrl-Alt-I__(talicize)
* __Ctrl-Alt-Q__(uote)
* __Ctrl-Alt-L__(ist)
* __Ctrl-Alt-C__(ode)
* __Ctrl-Alt-T__(able)
* __Ctrl-Alt-M__(age) [sic]
* __Ctrl-Alt-U__(RL) Link
